I followed [this tutorial](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/english-build-a-budget?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=profile_web&utm_campaign=profile) by Ironhack and added some extra functionalities:

- integrated _parseFloat_ instead of _parseInt_ to use up to two decimal numbers
- list elements are now removable and balance is updated accordingly
- added a description field
- preventing empty entries from being added
